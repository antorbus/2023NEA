# 2023NEA
This repo contains the code needed to run/train my implementation of a Go engine + GUI with a deep learning agent (Japanese rules). Everything is made from scratch using numpy, pygame and pytorch. The model was trained on a single GPU for around 12h and manages to suggest some decent moves, however it sometimes predicts moves that lack purpose or are blunders. This code was submitted for my computer science A Level NEA project.

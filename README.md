This repo contains the code need to run/train my implementation of a Go GUI with an deep learning agent to go with it. Every is made from scratch using numpy, pygame and pytorch. The model was trained on a single GPU for around 12h and manages suggest some decent moves, however it sometimes predicts moves that lack purposes or are blunders. This code was submitted for my computer science A Level NEA project.
